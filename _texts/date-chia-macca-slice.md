You can use this recipe to either make bliss balls, or compact the mixture in a cake tin as a slice. 

### Ingredients
* 15 pitted dates, chopped up into tiny pieces 
* 50 grams chia seeds
* 1 teaspoon maca powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
* 50 grams slithered almonds
* 75 grams walnuts, crushed
* 3-4 tablespoons shredded coconut
* 2-3 tablespoons coconut oil (as required)

### Method
1. Combine the dates, chia seeds, maca powder, cinnamon, almonds, walnuts, and 3 tablespoons shredded coconut.
2. At this stage, you should be able to roll the mixture into balls that stick together well. If not, add 1 tablespoon of coconut oil at a time until the mixture will stick together well. 
3. If making a slice, spread the mixture out evenly in a bread or cake tin and compact down, then cover in remaining coconut and refrigerate.
4. If making into bliss balls, take small amounts of the mixture and roll into balls. Coat the balls in the shredded coconut.

Can be stored in the fridge for up to two weeks.
