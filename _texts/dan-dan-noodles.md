 A fast and simple way to produce a punchy bowl of noodles.

**Serves: 2-4 people** 

**Preparation time: 10 minutes** 

**Cooking time: 20 minutes** 

### Ingredients
* 1 beef stock cube
* 250 grams minced beef
* 1 tablespoon runny honey
* 300 grams Hokkien noodles
* 4 large handfuls of mixed green vegetables (Brocolini, bok choi, baby spinach, etc)
* 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce
* 2 teaspoons freshly ground Szechuan pepper
* 3 tablespoons sesame oil (or chilli oil for more punch)
* 2 spring onions, finely sliced
* 1 lime, quartered, to serve

### Method

1. Add the beef mince to a dry pan on a medium to high heat. Keep the mince moving around until in becomes golden brown and a little crunchy, which will take 10-15 minutes. Pour away any excess liquid and then add the honey and toss until all the meat is coated. 

2. While the meat is cooking, crumble the stock cube into a pan of water, bring to the boil, then add your noodles and cook to the packets instructions. 

3. Chop/shred your vegetables and add to the noodles and water when the noodles have a bout 1 minute left to cook to blanch them. Then drain the whole lot in a colander, and reserve about 1 cup of the liquid, then tip it all back into the hot pan with the reserved liquid.

4. Add the garlic, soy sauce, spring onions, Szechuan pepper and sesame or chilli oil and give it a good stir around. Divide this among your bowls (2-4) and sprinkle over the crunchy beef (reheat the beef if necessary). 

5. Squeeze a quarter of lime over each bowl to serve.
