I recently cooked this dish for my Sardinian friend Alessandro. Being Italian, he was both skeptical of a vegetarian lasagne, and an Australian cooking Italian food. His skepticism soon abated. I recommend cooking with freshly made pasta which is faster to prepare than most imagine - it is not some temperamental nightmare. However, this dish is equally fine with dried lasagne sheets from the supermarket.  

Serves 8

### Pasta
* 5 large free-range eggs
* 500 grams strong flour (type 00)
* Semolina flour for dusting

### Sauce 
* 4 x 400g cans tomatoes (or fresh equivalent)
* 1 tablespoon tomato paste 
* 2 cloves garlic, peeled 

### The rest
* 2 medium eggplants (400-500 grams)
* 1 large zucchini (500 grams)
* 2 large red capsicums 
* 4 tablespoons olive oil
* 6 silver-beet leaves, stems removed
* 2 large mozzarella balls (250 grams drained)
* 1 handful basil leaves
* 100 grams freshly grated Parmesan cheese

### Method

### Pasta
1. Put the flour and eggs into a food processor and turn it on. Within 30 seconds, the should look like sticky breadcrumbs. Leave it for a little longer to start working the gluten when it combines into larger balls of dough. Once this occurs and the sides of the food processor bowl are clean, take it out and work the dough by hand for about 2 minutes, or until silky, smooth and elastic. Wrap in cling-film and allow to rest in the fridge for 1 hour. 

2. **With a pasta machine:** Remove the dough from the fridge and divine into 4 balls, and work with 1 ball at a time, while keeping the others covered. Flatten the ball of dough with the palm of your hand and run it through the pasta machine on the thickest setting. Then fold the the two ends into the middle of the sheet and repeat this on the thickest setting 3-4 times to get the pasta to fill out to the full width of the machine. Then lightly dust the pasta sheet and progressively run it through the machine on thinner settings. On my machine, I start on setting 7, progressing down to setting 4, which results in sheets 1-1.5 mm think (slightly thicker for lasagne is ok).

**With a rolling-pin:** Remove the dough from the fridge and divine into 2 balls, and re-cover 1 ball. Flatten the uncovered ball slightly with the palm of your hand, and lightly flour your working surface and rolling pin. Begin rolling out away from you, dusting and turning 90 degrees. Continue until you have a very thin pasta sheet of 1-2mm.

### Sauce and vegetable preparation
3. Pre-heat oven to 200 C. Put all the ingredients for the sauce in a saucepan and bring to the boil, and simmer gently for 30 minutes, then remove from the heat. 

4. Put whole capsicums in a roasting tin and roast in the oven for about 30 minutes, or until they begin to char, then remove from the oven and cover the tin with foil so it is air tight. 

5. While the capsicums are cooking, trim the ends off the eggplants and zucchinis and slice longways into about 5mm strips. Brush the vegetable strips with olive oil and place in a separate roasting trays and roast for 20-30 minutes, turning once, until lightly browned. 

6. When the capsicums are cool enough to handle, cut in half, remove the seeds and peel off this skin, and cut the flesh into long strips. 

7. Shred the silver-beet and lightly steam until wilted (an efficient way to do this is to steam over the simmering sauce). 

### Assembly

8. Spoon a thin layer of tomato sauce in to a lasagne dish of about 25cm x 35cm and cover with one layer of pasta sheets. 

9. Cover the first pasta sheet with another layer of tomato sauce, then a layer of eggplant and zucchini and season lightly.

10. Tear the mozzarella into small pieces and dot them and basil leaves all over the zucchini, and cover with another layer of pasta. 

11. Arrange the capsicum on top of the second layer of pasta and then the silver-beet on top of the capsicum and season lightly, before covering with another layer of tomato sauce, then cover with the final layer of pasta.

12. On top of the final pasta sheets, spoon the remaining tomato sauce, then scatter the grated Parmesan and any remaining mozzarella.   

### Cooking

13. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180C for 45-60 minutes, or until lasagne is bubbling and slightly browned on top. 

***Note that this meal can be prepared in stages. For example, you could freeze the pasta sheets prior to making or cook the sauce and roast vegetables the day before and put in the fridge. Alternatively, you can fully assemble, refrigerate, and then cook the next day.***
