From Grandpa’s recipe book:
_This recipe is from my American trip diary when I visited MaryAnne and Al Reiner in June 1994 at their Corralitos Ranch in California. I visited for two wonderful weeks on my own, spending time between having fun with MaryAnne in her art studio, visiting her family, enjoying San Fransisco and the “Phantom of the Opera” with her sister, local trips to Monterey and environs with Alan and spending happy times just chatting and eating._

_MaryAnne made these hotcakes for me for breakfast one day. We had them with maple syrup, eggs and meat. They were the best I’ve ever had, so I got the recipe. It belonged to MaryAnne’s mother who was quite a ‘Gal’, which seems to be the term for older women here! She was an artist also I am told and she died in 1993 at the ripe old age of 92._

_This recipe is at least 60 years old (in 1994), possibly older than that._

Rest In Peace Grandpa 💚
