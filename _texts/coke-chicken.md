A really simple and non-conventional chicken recipe that is surprisingly good! This dish goes really well served with [Chinese broccoli]({{ site.url }}/texts/chinese-broccoli/) and steamed rice.

### Ingredients

* 10-12 chicken pieces with bones (drumsticks, thighs, wings)
* 1 cup Coca-Cola (the original, no diet varieties)
* 60 milliliters soy sauce
* 2 tablespoons Chinese five-spice powder
* 1 teaspoon ground cumin
* 1 large brown onion, finely chopped
* 4 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* Salt and black pepper


### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 200C and arrange the chicken pieces in a roasting tin. 
2. Mix together all the other ingredients in a bowl and pour over the chicken in the roasting tin. 
3. Cover the tin with aluminum foil and bake in the oven for 15 minutes, then turn over the pieces and baste with the juices, cover with foil again and bake for another 15 minutes. 
4. Remove the foil and baste again and return to the oven for another 20 minutes without the foil. If it looks too dry add a splash of water. 
5. Once the chicken is cooked and has slightly crispy and sticky skin, remove from the oven onto a plate and spoon over some of the sticky sauce.
