This is a super fast and easy meal to prepare and works well for summer lunches. Although it's not really a traditional Thai recipe, it does capture some of that classical Thai flavour.


**Serves: 6-8 people** 

**Preparation time: 10 minutes** 

**Cooking time: 20 minutes** 

### Ingredients

### For the chicken cakes 
* 1 kg chicken thighs, roughly chopped
* 4 garlic cloves
* 2 long red or green chillies, thinly sliced (optional)
* 2 handfuls baby spinach leaves
* 4 teaspoons fish sauce
* 1 teaspoon turmeric 
* 6 tablespoons coconut cream
* 2 teaspoons grated ginger

### To serve 
* Iceberg lettuce leaves, as cups
* 1 avocado
* 1 cucumber
* Small bunch coriander
* 1 lime

### Method

1. Preheat oven to 180C, and lightly grease a 12-cup muffin tin.
2. Place the chicken thighs, garlic, chilli, spinach, fish sauce, turmeric, coconut cream and ginger in a food processor and pulse until you have a finely chopped mixture. 
3. Spoon the chicken mixture evenly into the muffin tin, then bake in the over for 15-20 minutes, or until cooked through. 
4. Once cooked, remove the tin from the oven and allow the cakes to cool for a few minutes before turning out. There will be some liquid in the bottom of the tin cups, so make sure you drain the cakes before removing. 
5. Place the lettuce cups on plates, and place 1-2 cakes in the lettuce cups along with some avocado and cucumber. Garnish with coriander leaves and lime juice. 


### Notes
These chicken cakes freeze quite well for up to 3 months.
