This cake is very well balanced, being not too rich nor too sweet. My former housemate Grishma shared this recipe with me, and I think it will become my go-to chocolate cake recipe. 

### Ingredients
* 1/2 cup caster sugar
* 1/2 cup firmly packed brown sugar
* 1/2 cup neutral oil
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* pinch salt
* 1/2 tsp cinnamon
* 1/2 cup cocoa powder
* 1 cup plain flour
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 cups firmly packed grated zucchini (about 4 small zucchini)

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180Â°C. Grease and line a loaf tin with baking paper.
2. Place the sugars, oil, vanilla, eggs, salt and cinnamon in a mixing bowl.
3. Whisk together until combined. Sift in the cocoa powder, flour, baking powder and baking soda.
5. Using a rubber spatula, fold the dry mixture into the wet mixture until just combined. Add the grated zucchini and stir through.
6. Pour the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and bake for 50-60 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean.

*The main challenge is achieving a cake that will not collapse in the centre after cooling*
