I recently stayed with my good friend David at his home in the woods of Kentucky. At every meal, we found some way of adding the dressing for this salad, be it on salad leaves with eggs for breakfast, or pizza in the evening. It's simply a a great way to add umami, and the dressing keeps for days. 

### The Dressing
* 6 anchovy fillets packed in oil, drained
* 1 small garlic clove
* Kosher salt
* 2 large egg yolks
* 2 tablespoons fresh lemon juice, plus more
* ¾ teaspoon Dijon mustard
* 2 tablespoons olive oil
* ½ cup vegetable oil
* 3 tablespoons finely grated Parmesan
* Freshly ground black pepper

### The Croutons
* 3 cups torn 1" pieces country bread, with crusts
* 3 tablespoons olive oil

### The Lettuce
* 3 romaine hearts, leaves separated

### The Cheese
* Parmesan, for serving

### Method
1. Chop together anchovy fillets, garlic, and pinch of salt. Use the side of a knife blade to mash into a paste, then scrape into a medium bowl. Whisk in egg yolks, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and mustard. Adding drop by drop to start, gradually whisk in olive oil, then vegetable oil; whisk until dressing is thick and glossy. Whisk in Parmesan. Season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice, if desired.

2. Make your own croutons. Tearing, not cutting the bread ensures nooks and crannies that catch the dressing and add texture. Preheat oven to 375°. Toss bread with olive oil on a baking sheet; season with salt and pepper. Bake, tossing occasionally, until golden, 10–15 minutes.

3. For the lettuce, use whole leaves; they provide the ideal mix of crispness, surface area, and structure.

4. Caesars crowned with a mound of grated Parmesan may look impressive, but all that clumpy cheese mutes the dressing. Instead, use a vegetable peeler to thinly shave a modest amount on top for little salty bursts.

5. For the assembly, skip the tongs. Use your hands to gently toss the lettuce, croutons, and dressing, then top off with the shaved Parmesan.
