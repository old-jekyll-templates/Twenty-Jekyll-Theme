Serves 4

### Ingredients

* 1 head of broccoli
* ½ cup wild black rice
* 1 cup mixed puffed grains (Something like equal parts amaranth, quinoa, millet, and buckwheat)
* 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds
* 2 tablespoons pepitas 
* 2 tablespoons crushed walnuts
* 2 spring onions, chopped
* 2 tablespoons finely diced parsley
* Juice of a lemon
* 2 apple cider vinegar vinegar
* 3 tablespoon garlic infused olive oil
* 20 grams smooth fetta
* Black Nigella seeds to serve

### Method

1. Heat a cast iron pan on medium-high and once hot, add two tablespoons of the wild black rice at a time allowing it to pop and toast, jiggle the pan a bit until its all toasted. Put aside in a heat proof bowl and repeat until all the rice has been toasted.
2. Switch of the heat and toast the sunflower seeds and pepitas in the retained heat of the pan. Put all the dry ingredients into a bowl and set aside.
3. In another bowl combine the lemon juice, vinegar, oil, parsley and spring onion. Chop the broccoli into 1.5 centimetre florets and place in a colander. Boil approximately 1 litre of water, then pour over the broccoli. Then run under cold water to refresh. Drain and toss in the dressing. Alternatively, lightly steam the broccoli.
4. Now add the toasted puffed dry ingredients and mix well. Transfer to a serving bowl and top with crumbled fetta and sprinkle with black Nigella seeds.
