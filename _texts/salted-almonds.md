A super-simple way to produce great salted almonds every time.

### Ingredients
* 200 grams almonds
* 2 teaspoons salt

### Method
1. Toss together the almonds and salt in a ceramic bowl with 2 tablespoons of water. Cook the almonds in two batches to ensure even cooking.
2. Cover the bowl of almonds with plastic wrap and microwave on high for 2 minutes, then remove the plastic wrap and shake the bowl, then recover and microwave for a further 1 minute. The almonds should just be starting to brown in the middle. If they aren't, recover and microwave for a further minute.
3. Allow to cool and brush of any excess salt before serving.
