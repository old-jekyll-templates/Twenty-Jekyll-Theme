This banana cake recipe is adapted from a recipe from the Sra Bua restaurant in the Siam Kempinski Hotel in Bangkok. The flour-less version can be challenging. Feel free to substitute the almond meal for flour, or experiment with different ratios of the two.

### Ingredients
* 70 grams butter
* 2 tablespoons honey
* 3/4 cup almond meal
* 1/2 cup caster sugar
* 1 1/4 tablespoons potato or banana starch
* 1 tablespoon coconut flakes
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder
* 1 vanilla bean 
* 2 egg whites
* 1 large ripe banana, peeled and mashed

### Method
1. Preheat the oven to 180C.
2. Melt the butter and honey in a pan over low heat.
3. Combine all the dry ingredients in a large bowl, then stir in the melted butter mixture, followed by the egg whites and mashed banana.
4. Line a cake tin with non-stick baking paper and spoon in the mixture.
5. Bake for ~20 minutes and cool on a rack.

Serve with the [salted coconut ice-cream]({{ site.url }}/texts/coconut-ice-cream/) and caramel sauce.

*The main challenge is achieving a cake that will not collapse in the centre after cooling*
