Lamb korma is one of my favorite Indian curries. There is a lot of variety in korma recipes out there, and this is just another one. I have experimented a lot with this dish and think this recipe strikes a nice balance between simplicity in preparation and complexity in flavour. 

**Preperation time:** 15 minutes

**Cooking time:** ~4 hours

### Ingredients
* 5 cm piece of ginger
* 6 cloves garlic
* 2 tablespoons Garam Marsala powder
* 1 pinch saffron threads
* 2 tablespoons of vegetable or coconut oil
* 1 kg diced boneless lamb shoulder or other cheap cut
* Sea salt
* Black pepper
* 1 brown onion, finely chopped
* 2 fresh green chillies 
* 250 ml lamb or beef stock
* 250 ml coconut milk
* 80 grams cashews, smashed in a mortar and pestle
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric
* Coriander to serve

### Method
1. Finely chop the ginger and garlic, then smash in a mortar and pestle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt and 1 tablespoon of water until you have a chunky paste.
2. Put the saffron in a small bowl with 2 tablespoons of boiling water and steep for a least 10 minutes. 
3. Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to a pan and add the meat with plenty of ground pepper and brown for 1-2 minutes and remove to a bowl. 
4. Add another 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan with the onion and whole chillies over medium heat and fry for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.
5. Add the ginger and garlic paste and cook for another minute. 
6. Add the garam marsala to the pan and fry the spices briefly before returning the meat to the pan with juices and cover with the all the spices. 
7. Add the stock, coconut milk, ground cashews, cinnamon stick, saffron with water, turmeric and a good pinch of salt and stir through. 
8. Bring to a low simmer, cover and cook for 2-3 hours, stirring occasionally. Or add to a slow cooker to complete.
9. Once the meat this fork-tender, remove the cover, check the seasoning and cook for another 30 minutes to thicken.
10. Garnish with coriander and serve with rice. 

### Variations
* Substitute lamb for beef
* Remove chillies for those who can't handle the heat
