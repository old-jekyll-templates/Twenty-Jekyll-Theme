### Ingredients

* 400 ml Ayam coconut cream
* 400 g thinly sliced chicken thigh fillet
* 1-2 tablespoons of Mae Ploy green curry paste (adjust to taste) 
* 2 handfuls of small Thai eggplants or substitute with 1 sliced zucchini
* 1 Kaffir lime leaf
* 2 tablespoons of fish sauce
* Small handful sweet basil
* 1/2 tablespoon palm sugar (optional)

### Method

1. Mix the curry paste, sugar and fish sauce in a small bowl and set aside.
2. Pour half the coconut cream into a wok and heat over medium heat for 3-5 minutes, stirring occasionally until the coconut oil starts to separate out.
3. Add the curry paste mixture to the wok and stir until you can smell the aroma of the heating curry paste.
4. Add the chicken and stir until the outside of the chicken turns white.
5. Pour the other half of the coconut cream into the wok and bring to the boil.
6. Add the kaffir lime leaf and eggplant (or zucchini).
7. Cook for 2-3 minutes until chicken is cooked through and vegetables are cooked, but not too soft.
8. Remove from heat and immediately stir through the basil leaves.
9. Garnish with a few fresh basil leaves (and chilli if you like).
10. Serve with Jasmine rice.

### Notes
I recommend using only coconut cream or milk that is 100% coconut kernal with no other additives, such as Ayam brand.
I also recommend Mae Ploy Green Curry paste, or make your own. There is huge variety out there and not all are good.
