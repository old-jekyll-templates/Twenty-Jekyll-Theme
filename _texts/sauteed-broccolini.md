A simple way to prepare broccolini or beans, and great with a Sunday roast chicken.

### Ingredients

* 2 tablespoons sea salt
* 4 bunches broccolini
* 3 tablespoons olive oil
* 3 cloves garlic, crushed

### Method

In a large saucepan, bring ~8 cups of water and the salt to a boil. Remove and discard the bottom third of the broccolini stems.

Once the water is fully boiling, add the broccolini, return to a boil, and cook over high heat for 2 minutes. The stalks should be crisp, with a slight tenderness. Drain and immediately immerse the broccolini in a large bowl filled with ice water to stop the cooking. Drain.

Heat the oil in a saute pan. Add the garlic and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes. Add the broccolini and stir until heated through.
