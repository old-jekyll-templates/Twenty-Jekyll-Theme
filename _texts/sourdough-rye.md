### Ingredients

* Water: 400 grams (1 3/4 cups)
* Sourdough Starter: 70 grams (1/3 cup)
* Rye Flour: 245 grams (1 3/4 cups)
* Bread Flour: 245 grams (1 3/4 cups)
* Molasses: 44 grams (2 Tbs)
* Salt: 12 grams (1 3/4 tsp)

#### Optional
* Fennel Seed: 8 grams (1 Tbs)
* Anise Seed: 2 grams (1 tsp)
* Caraway Seed: 3 grams (1 tsp)
* Zest of 1 Orange

### Method

1. In a mixing bowl, mix the starter into the water. Add the molasses, all the seeds and orange zest.
2. In a separate bowl, combine the flours and salt.
3. Gradually stir the dry ingredients into the wet using a dough whisk or spoon until the flour is well incorporated. Cover with plastic and let rest for 15 minutes.
4. After about 15 minutes, mix again for a minute or two. Again, let rest for another 15 minutes.
5. Mix one more time as before. Now cover the bowl with plastic and let sit at room temperature for roughly 12-14 hours.

6. After the long 12-14 hour proof, stretch and fold the dough and shape into an oblong shape for baking. Cover again with plastic and let rest 15 minutes before putting in a bread tin for the final rise. The final rise should last somewhere between 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Keep the dough covered with plastic to prevent it from drying out.
7. Preheat your oven to 245 C a half hour before baking.
8. Bake until the internal temp is about 90 C. This should take ~30-35 mins.
9. Let cool completely on a rack before slicing.

### Notes
Regarding 12-14 hour proofing period: You can prepare everything in the evening for baking the next morning. You can also mix everything up in the morning and refrigerate until evening then remove before bed to resume the proofing at room temperature. Alternatively, if you get started with mixing everything up early enough in the morning, the bread can also be ready to bake in the evening. This is a nice option when you want fresh bread ready to eat for breakfast.

Regarding the final proofing: To test for final proof rising, prod the dough gently with your finger. The dough is ready for the oven when the indentation comes out fully in about a minute.  More than a minute = not ready.  Significantly less than a minute (or dough that is so soft and airy that your finger goes straight in) = dough over proofed.  Bubbles on the top of the dough also indicate that it is over proofed.  If your dough is seriously over proofed, you can take it out, knead it again with some more flour, shape it and  wait for an hour or so and it should be oven ready. You are looking for your sourdough to rise by 50% - not by the 100% that you are looking for in a yeasted dough.
