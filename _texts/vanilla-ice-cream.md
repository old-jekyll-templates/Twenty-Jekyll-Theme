You may like eating ice cream, but I doubt you like it more than me. When I was growing up, on the day my mum would do the grocery shopping I would rush home from school to eat all the ice-cream so I wouldn't have to share any with my sister. I just had to have it all. Vanilla has always been my favorite, and I think this recipe produces an amazing example of this classic dessert. 

### Ingredients
* 5 vanilla pods, halved length-ways
* 360 ml milk
* 175 grams caster sugar
* 840 grams whipping cream
* 1 large cinnamon stick 

### Method

1. Scrape the vanilla seed from the pods. In a saucepan, combine vanilla seeds and pods, milk, sugar and cream.
2. Place saucepan over medium heat, add the cinnamon stick and bring to the boil.
3. Remove pan from heat immediately and pour the mixture into a bowl in the sink, and surround the bowl with cold water to cool the mixture as quickly as possible. 
4. Once the mixture has cooled, place the bowl in the refrigerator 24 hours. 
5. Turn on your ice-cream machine at least 20 minutes before using it to get it as cold as possible before beginning to churn the mixture. 
6. Strain the ice-cream mixture through a fine sieve and pour into the machine and begin churning. 
7. Churn the ice-cream until the paddle can no longer turn and decant into a suitable container and freeze for at least 3 hours before serving.
