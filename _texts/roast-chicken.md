### Ingredients

* 1 large whole chicken (~1.2-1.5 kg)
* 1 Lemon 
* 8 rosemary sprigs
* 2 handfuls fresh delicate herbs (basil, parsley, marjoram), finely chopped.
* 1 handful flat leaf parsley
* Ground black pepper
* 4 bay leaves
* Salt
* Cotton string


### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 225C. 
2. Wash the chicken inside and out under cold running tap water, then pat dry as much as possible using paper towel.
3. Very carefully, grab the skin of the chicken at the tip of the breasts and pull up gently. With your other hand, gently separate the skin from the breast meat making two tunnels along either breast.
4. Within these gaps between the skin and breast, sprinkle in some salt and gently stuff in some of the chopped herbs and drizzle in a little olive oil. 
5. Roll the lemon on the kitchen bench firmly to soften it, the poke it with a fork about six times in different places, then push it into the cavity, followed by the bay leaves and two rosemary sprigs. 
6. Tie up the chicken by firstly by taking ~60 cm string and tying the two leg tips together in the centre of the string. Now run each side of the sting between the legs and the breasts on each side, then tuck it over to the top side of the chicken tying the wings firmly against the body. 
7. Tuck the remaining sprigs of rosemary under the string between the legs and wings. 
8. Rub any remaining chopped herbs on the outside of the chicken and season with salt and pepper all over.
9. Place in the oven for ~1 hour, ideally on a trivet.

### Optional brining 
To ensure the chicken stays juicy and moist, cover the chicken in an 8% brine solution overnight in the refrigerator. Before cooking, remove the chicken from the brine solution and rinse as described above.

To make the brine solution, add 80 grams of salt per litre of water. You will likely have to heat the water to get all the salt to dissolve completely.
