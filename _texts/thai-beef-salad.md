 There is a lot of variety in Thai beef salad recipes, and I've experimented with many of them. I think this example strikes a great balance between simplicity and authentic Thai flavor.

**Serves: ~4 people** 

**Preparation time: 25 minutes** 

**Cooking time: 10 minutes** 

### Ingredients
* 400 grams vermicelli noodles
* sea salt 
* black pepper
* 600 grams high quality beef fillet, such as eye fillet
* 3 spring onions, finely sliced on the diagonal
* 1 small handful Thai basil leaves, roughly chopped
* 1 small handful mint leaves, roughly chopped
* 1 small handful coriander leaves
* 2 tablespoons of chopped almonds

#### Dressing
* 2 tablespoons finely diced ginger
* 2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander stems
* 3 cloves garlic, finely chopped
* 1 long red chilli, finely sliced
* 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar
* 2 tablespoons tamari (or soy sauce)
* 1 tablespoon finely chopped lemongrass (white part)
* 1 tablespoon sesame oil
* 3 tablespoons olive oil (EVOO is best) 

### Method

1. Soak the vermicelli noodles in hot water for ~5 minutes, then drain and set aside.
2. Heat the barbecue or grill and season the beef well with salt and pepper then press the seasoning into the meat with the back of a spatula or your hand. 
3. Lightly oil the grill and cook the fillet for 4-5 minutes each side, then remove, set aside and rest.
4. For the dressing, combine the ginger, coriander, garlic, chilli, vinegar, tamari, lemongrass, sesame oil in a bowl and mix well. 
5. Pour half the dressing over the noodles, with half the herbs and gently toss. 
6. To serve, arrange the noodles in a large bowl or platter and top with beef, spring onion and remaining herbs and dressing and almonds, then toss to combine. Can be served at room temperature or chilled.

### Note
The beef can be substituted for high quality kangaroo fillet that is finely sliced.
