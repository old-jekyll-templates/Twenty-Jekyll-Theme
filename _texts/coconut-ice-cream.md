The ultimate dairy-free ice cream. Enough said.

### Ingredients
* 4 1/2 cups coconut milk
* 1 cup brown sugar
* 1 heaped teaspoon salt

### Method
1. Bring the coconut milk to boil in a pan over medium heat. 
2. Add the sugar and salt to the pan a stir for approximately five minutes to dissolve. 
3. Remove pan from heat and pour the mixture into a bowl in the sink, and surround the bowl with cold water to cool the mixture as quickly as possible. 
4. Once the mixture has cooled, place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill the mixture a much as possible before churning.
5. Turn on your ice-cream machine at least 20 minutes before using it to get it as cold as possible before beginning to churn the mixture.  
7. Churn the ice-cream for approximately 40 minutes or until the paddle begins to struggle turning, then decant into a suitable container and freeze. 

### Note
I recommend using only coconut milk that is 100% coconut kernel with no other additives, such as Ayam brand. 

This ice cream pairs well with the [Thai banana cake]({{ site.url }}/texts/banana-cake/)
