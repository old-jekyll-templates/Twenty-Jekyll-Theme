My uncle Stu makes these pancakes for his family every Sunday morning. It produces pancakes just how I like 'em: Nice and flat without the cake like texture.

### Ingredients
* 250 grams flour
* 1 1/2 cups milk
* 60 grams butter 
* 3 eggs

### Method
1. Melt butter and combine with the milk together.
2. Beat eggs and flour together and combine and then combine with the butter and milk and mix until smooth and has the consistency of thick cream. 
3. Put a non-stick flat pan over medium-high with a dollop of butter. 
4. Pour enough of the pancake batter into the centre of the pan so it spreads to form a thin pancake of a few millimeters. 
5. Cook on the first side until some bubbles emerge on the surface and the underside is slightly browned, then flip and cook for another couple of minutes. 
6. Serve with your favorite topping such as maple syrup and ice cream.
