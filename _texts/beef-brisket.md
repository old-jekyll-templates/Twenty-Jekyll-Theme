_Serves 4–6_

### Ingredients
* 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
* 1.5kg beef brisket, cut into 4-6 pieces
* 1 onion, finely chopped
* 3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced
* 1 cup red wine
* 2 cups beef stock
* 2 cups water
* 3 cups tomato puree (passata)
* 6 bay leaves
* sea salt and cracked black pepper

### Method
1. Preheat oven to 180°C
2. Heat half the oil in a large ovenproof heavy-based saucepan over medium heat. Add the beef and cook for 4–5 minutes each side or until browned. Remove from the pan and set aside.
3. Add the remaining oil, the onion and garlic to the pan and cook, stirring, for 4–5 minutes or until softened.
4. Add the wine and cook for 3–4 minutes  or until reduced by half. Add the stock, water, tomato puree, bay leaves, salt and pepper and stir to  combine. Return the beef to the pan, with any juices, and bring to a simmer.
5. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, transfer to the oven and cook, turning the beef halfway through cooking time, for 3 hours or until very tender. Alternatively, use a slow cooker. 
6. Remove the beef from the sauce and place on a tray. Using 2 forks, shred the meat. Return the beef to the sauce and stir to combine. Remove and discard the bay leaves to serve.
