Instructions

    Combine all ingredients except rich simple syrup in a one-quart lidded glass jar. Shake to combine. Refrigerate 72 hours, shaking occasionally, at least once per day.
    Make rich simple syrup: dissolve 3 cups sugar in 1½ cups water over medium heat until sugar is completely dissolved. Allow to cool. Transfer to a container and refrigerate.
    After 72 hours, strain tonic mixture into a large glass pitcher. Strain tonic a second time, using a coffee filter or very fine cheesecloth.
    Whisk simple syrup into tonic until thoroughly combined.
    Pour tonic syrup through a funnel into storage bottles and store in the refrigerator.
