There are many lasagne recipes out there, but I don't think many are as good as Ali's lasagne. A classic sunday evening favorite with enough left over to put a few serves in the freezer. 

Serves 6+

### Buffalo mozzarella lasagne
* 9 instant lasagne sheets 
* 500g fresh buffalo or cow's-milk mozzarella 
* 100g freshly grated parmesan 

### Meat sauce 
* 1 tbsp extra virgin olive oil 
* 1 onion, finely chopped 
* 6 cloves garlic, finely chopped 
* 300g pork mince 
* 300g veal mince 
* sea salt and freshly ground pepper 
* 2 tsp plain flour 
* 2 tbsp balsamic vinegar 
* a pinch of caster sugar 
* 700ml tomato passata 
* 400g canned diced tomatoes 
* 2 large handfuls basil leaves 

### Béchamel sauce 
* 50g unsalted butter 
* 2 tbsp plain flour 
* 600ml milk 
* sea salt and freshly ground pepper

### Method

1. Preheat the oven to 190°C. Adjust the oven racks so the dish can sit in the middle.

2. To make the meat sauce, heat the oil in a large heavy-based frying pan over medium heat. Cook the onion, stirring occasionally, until softened but not browned. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the meats and a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up the meat with a wooden spoon, for 4 minutes or until it loses its raw colour but is not browned. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes. Add the vinegar and cook, stirring occasionally, until it has almost evaporated. Add the sugar, passata and tomatoes and simmer for 10 minutes or until the sauce thickens slightly. Check the seasoning, stir in the basil and set the meat sauce aside.

3. To make the béchamel, melt the butter in a heavy-based saucepan over low-medium heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring, for 1-2 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat and add the milk all at once, whisking constantly, to avoid any lumps. Return the pan to the heat and keep whisking, until the sauce boils and thickens. Remove from the heat and season.

4. To assemble the lasagne, spread a quarter of the meat sauce in the base of a 29cm x 23cm x 7cm lasagne dish. Place 3 of the lasagne sheets over the sauce. Spread another quarter of the sauce over the pasta, then a third of the mozzarella, torn into pieces. Continue layering the pasta, meat sauce and mozzarella two more times. Pour the béchamel sauce evenly over the final layer of mozzarella, then sprinkle with the parmesan. Cook the lasagne for 30 minutes or until the cheese is brown and the sauce is bubbling. Let the lasagne stand for 10 minutes before serving.

_Hot tip: The meat sauce can be cooled, covered and refrigerated for up to two days. Just reheat it before you assemble the lasagne_
