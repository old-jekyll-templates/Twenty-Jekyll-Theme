									<h3>Automate everything</h3>
									<p>
										Automation allows us to codify and iterate on every process. Whether it's the infrastructure that stands behind your product, the CICD pipelines that deliver value to your customers, or the test automation suites that keep your teams delivering multiple times a day, automation plays a central part in everything we do.

									<h3>Shift left</h3>
									<p>
										Engineering teams are the driving force behind your success, and the sooner they tackle testing, security, monitoring, the better. That's why we ensure that key engineering concerns are in the hands of engineers as soon as possible.

									<h3>The right fit</h3>
									<p>
										Ultimately, we build platforms for you and your engineers to run faster, so rather than just choosing the latest coolest obscure tech, we select tooling and technologies that fit with your team skillsets and engineering maturity.

									<h3>Do the right thing</h3>
									<p>
										We're here to do what's right for the good of your product and teams; that might mean we sometimes push back or question decisions when we foresee problems. We want to make sure you're getting the best outcome possible, and we're not afraid to challenge.
